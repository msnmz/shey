Each track is engineered for seamless looping, balanced volume, and warm tones that soothe without distraction. New releases arrive monthly to keep your sleep toolkit fresh.

### Mix builder
Create custom soundscapes in seconds: combine rain with a low hum of white noise, sprinkle in lullabies, and save the blend for one-tap access tomorrow night.

### Smart sleep timers
Choose a duration and let Luna fade out gently once everyone drifts off. The mini player keeps quick controls within thumb’s reach while the screen stays dim.

### Multilingual experience
